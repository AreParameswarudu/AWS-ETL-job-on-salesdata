# Raw Data.

The data was actually populated using python. It was not real data from any real time e-commerce website.
The reason behind populating data by own was that mostly everywhere( google, kaggle etc) the avalible data is almost cleaned and ready to query or to get insights. So to have a hands on with AWS Glue Studio (ETL jobs), a messy data is required that need to be transformed and hence the data.
